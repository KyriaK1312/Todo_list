# 📝 Simple To-Do List App

This is a basic **To-Do List** web application that allows users to:

- Add new tasks  
- Mark tasks as completed  
- Delete completed tasks  
- Store tasks in the browser's **localStorage** so the list is saved even after refreshing the page

## 🚀 Features

✅ Add tasks  
✅ Mark as completed  
✅ Delete tasks  
✅ Persistent data using `localStorage`  
✅ Responsive and user-friendly design

## 🛠️ Built With

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**

## 📦 How It Works

- When you type a task in the input field and click the add button, it appears in the task list.
- Clicking on a task marks it as "completed".
- Clicking again on a completed task deletes it from the list.
- All tasks are stored in the browser’s local storage, so even if you reload the page, your tasks will still be there.
